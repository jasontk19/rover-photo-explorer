# Mars Rover Mission Explorer

## Overview

* Explore and discover photos from Mars rover missions
* Bookmark noteworthy photos and view consolidated page of bookmarks

## Intent

<p>
This is a simple React app that was primarily just a fun way for me to 
exercise my newly acquired React & Redux skills.  Using Redux for state 
management in this app is totally unnecessary, I simply wanted to get
some hands-on experience working with it.

### TODO:
* Smart paging of photo results (currently only showing first 25)
* Improve styling and use consistent styling approach throughout app
* Allow flipping sort direction on Sol dropdown
* Typechecking with PropTypes throughout components
